 * never exceed MAX_INPUT_LENGTH (a macro defined in client_server_utils.h
 * which includes the space for the '\n' and null termininator) and all 
 * complete messages will be terminated with a newline character. To do 
 * this you will likely want to use the built in getc function. One 
 * important note about the getc function is that since we are reading from 
 * stdin while it is non-blocking (meaning we do not wait for input to arrive)
 * if no input is available getc will return the MACRO EOF, which has the 
 * value -1. You will need to explicitly check for this as otherwise our 
 * autograder my note be able to have your client receive messages. Finally, 
 * don't forget to readd the "[Me:]" prefix after the message is sent. 
 * You may find a display_prefix helpful. To send a message you will want
 * to use the send_message function that is provided for you in client_utils.h.
 * Don't forget to null terminate any string you send. */
